## Project Overview
This project aims to develop a predictive model for residential property prices using machine learning techniques. The model analyzes various property characteristics to provide accurate price estimations, helping buyers, sellers, and developers make informed decisions.

## Features
- Data cleaning and preprocessing pipeline
- Exploratory data analysis with visualizations
- Multiple machine learning models for comparison
- Hyperparameter tuning for optimal performance
- Comprehensive evaluation metrics

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/property-price-prediction.git
```

2. Install the required packages:
```bash 
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Data
The dataset includes property features such as:

- Location
- Size
- Number of rooms
- Year built
- Amenities
- And more...

## Models
The following machine learning algorithms were implemented and compared:

- Linear Regression
- Ridge Regression
- Lasso Regression
- Random Forest
